# Presentation Suggestions

Ensure that you can clearly articulate the main goal of your presentation: what do you want your audience to take away from it?

Before using slides as a default mode of your presentation, brainstorm potential other ways in which you can present.
	* Can you draw things instead?
	* Can you use pen/paper/whiteboard/tablet? 
	* Can you use physical objects to illustrate/explain different concepts?
	* In what other way can you be creative with your demo? 
	* What would you do differently if this was part of a [TED](http://ted.com/) talk?

If you decide to use slides, use them as an aid instead of as a replacement of your of talk.
If you plan to share your slides as a reference, consider creating additional (hidden) slides that can be distributed separately from the slides that you use for your talk.


## Slides

### Text

* Use informative slide headings. E.g., if your slide is titled “User” and the slide describes “User Actions”, the latter is a more informative heading.

* Make your bullet points concise -- no need for full sentences.
	* Ask yourself: **What is the “take-away”? What is the motivation behind including this slide and each item on this slide? Can you leave it out?**
	* Aim for no more than 3-5 bullet points per slide with enough spacing between them. Limit your text to max 20 words/slide.
	* Make every bullet point begin with the same part of speech (e.g., an action verb) -- such consistency makes it easier to read/digest the slides.

* Make your slides readable: use the font size 20-24 *at a minimum* (that includes your figures!). 
	* Ensure that bullets **and** sub-bullets follow the minimum font size guidelines.
	* Enlarging the font will also eliminate too much text from the slides. 

* Avoid dark text on dark background (same goes for light text on light background). 
	*  If using color-coding, **do not use red/green** as distinguishing colors (red/green color-blindness is the most common -- color-blind people see distinct colors, e.g., red and green, as being indistinguishable from each other).

* Spell-check your slides!

### Figures

* Make it easy for the audience to see/read the content of the figures.
	* Circle, highlight or otherwise draw attention to the relevant elements.
	* Refer to the point about the minimum font size and color.

*  Remember to always label your axes in the graphs, include a readable legend, and provide an informative caption.

* Create an effective functionality/diagram walk-through using step-by-step animations (they can guide audience’s attention to the appropriate section of the slide or a figure).

### Last Slide

*  “Thank you!" and/or "Questions?” (possibly with some clip art) as the last slide is **not** informative -- including an overview/major feature highlights on the last slide is more helpful (and can help you address the audience’s questions without having to scroll through your slides).
* Include a “Possible Questions” on the last slide -- it can provide a starting point and/or help your audience formulate their questions. 
* Avoid listing generic headings displaying an outline of your talk; include a major takeaway or 2-3 highlights of your talk, show a diagram of the system, or display anything else that could help your audience ask questions and/or help you answer them.
* Bonus tip: include an Appendix with the helpful slides that you might bring up during the Q&A.


## Style
* Introduction is the easiest part to rehearse and get a great start to your presentation -- don’t skip over it. 
* Find an engaging start to the presentation: asking the audience a question, adding an anecdote or an illustrative example. 
Be creative but also be respectful!
* Be aware of your non-verbal actions as they can be a bit distracting and give away your nervousness (which can be translated as the lack of preparation).
* It’s never good to be surprised by your own slides (and/or their animations). Make sure to rehearse the full flow of your talk.
	* Rehearse the presentation at least a couple of times to practice the logical flow of slide progression and timing. 
	* Practicing will help you figure out transitions between the slides, which might minimize the number of “uhm”s and other filler words during the talk. 
	* Using planned transitions between different parts of the slide and subsequent slides (and maybe making them part of a story) would bring your content to life, help enhance the motivation behind the explanation, and engage your audience.
* Having pauses in the presentation is OK, since it gives the audience a chance to take in the information and follow you better. 
* Slower speaking speed creates an impression of monotonous speaking. Slightly picking up the pace of your delivery might make your presentation even more engaging.
* Plan how to wrap-up your presentation: don’t just end it abruptly. You could, for example, go over the major take-aways (see the notes about the Last Slide).


## Presenting Remotely

* If using an IDE or an editor for your presentation, increase the font size, so that those who are watching your talk on smaller screens can still see what you are typing. (Note that if you have a large display, its higher resolution means that someone watching the talk on their tablet would see your entire desktop squished on their screen.)
* When sharing your screen, remove other distracting elements: e.g., close unnecessary tabs, so that you have only the windows/tabs which you need for your demo.
* Your microphone should not be rubbing on your clothes, hair, or be too close or too far.
* Record your full presentation each time you practice your demo.
	* Watch your recording. Take notes.
	* Record your talk more than once to practice timing.


## Presenting in-person

* Take into account that, generally, projectors seem to make dark colors even darker while lighter colors appear even lighter. Be mindful that what you see on the computer screen is not how the slide might be displayed. 
	*  Check the slides to make sure they are displayed correctly.
	* Try out the slides in the room where you will be presenting, before your actual presentation. 
	* Use the computer you plan to use during the presentation.
	* Leave yourself enough time to make the necessary changes based on what you learn from this test.

* Rehearsing might also help eliminate the need to repeatedly look at the projector/computer screen --> make eye contact with the audience.
Looking directly at the audience can be unnerving, so you use a few tricks to help you with your presentation delivery: e.g., face the audience but you don’t have to look directly at people, and instead, select a few spots in the room, near the audience.


## Additional Notes

* For databases:
  * Simply describing what is stored in each table quickly loses the audience, since they can read it off of the slide. 
  * Explain the motivation and the reasoning for selecting it, what it enables you to do.
* For functionality:
  * Simply describing what the user does, and what the next step is, and what they do next, and so on and so forth, quickly loses the audience. 
  * Using planned transitions between different parts of the slide and subsequent slides (and maybe making them part of a story) would bring your content to life, help you enhance the motivation behind the features you are introducing, and engage your audience.
* Technical glitches could be avoided by testing the exact demo walkthrough in advance, and then freezing the master branch until the presentation is over.
